# Introduction {.unnumbered}

I used to think that tables are dull lists of numbers.
But I was wrong.
Tables can be beautiful & engaging.
And in this Quarto book, we're going to learn how to create such tables with R.
More precisely, we will learn how to use the [`{gt}` package](https://gt.rstudio.com/index.html).

[@sec-getting-started] is the starting point of our `{gt}` journey.
It will cover both useful guidelines for any table and how to implement them with `{gt}`.
You can think of this chapter as a quickstart guide.

Afterwards, we're learning how to add eye-catching elements like plots, icons and images to our table in [@sec-fancy-stuff].
Many of these elements are powered through the amazing [`{gtExtras}` package](https://jthomasmock.github.io/gtExtras/index.html).
But you will also learn how to add any plot to your table.
Regardless of whether it implemented in `{gtExtras}` or not.

Next, we'll talk about formatting the entries of your table in [@sec-formatting].
`{gt}` has two powerful sets of functions to get the job done, namely `fmt_*()` and `sub_*()`.
These functions all work the same and are pretty easy to pick up.
Hence, it's easy to format the data in your table the way you want/need.

In [@sec-styling], we're learning how to change the theme of our table.
This will be a long chapter.
After all, we can basically change anything about our table's appearance.

All of the knowledge that we've acquired in the previous chapters will culminate in [@sec-case-studies].
That's where we will build two elaborate tables with `{gt}`.

Finally, [@sec-quarto] is a special chapter dedicating to the interactions between [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and `{gt}`.
As of right now (Quarto `v1.2.267` & `{gt}` `v0.7.0.9000 Github (rstudio/gt@a4e108c)`),
Quarto's default theme can interact with your `{gt}` table and change its theme.
But there are ways to isolate Quarto from `{gt}`.
This is what you'll learn in this chapter.



## Prerequisites

This Quarto book is meant for people with an intermediate knowledge of R, specifically the Tidyverse.
I do not expect people to know HTML/CSS for the most parts.

Throughout most of the book, we'll only to do small changes with HTML/CSS and these bits will be explained.
But there will be parts in [@sec-styling] and the subsequent chapters that will talk about changing CSS styles.
Feel free to skip these parts if you're uncomfortable with CSS.
